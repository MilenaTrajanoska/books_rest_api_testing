## Project: Functional and Performance Testing of a REST API

This repository is part of a project for functional and performance testing of a [books REST API](https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/rest_api).
The repository contains the functinal and performance tests.
The functional test are located under the [src/test/java](https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/books_rest_api_testing/tree/main/src/test/java) directory in the [BooksRestApiFunctionalTests.java](https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/books_rest_api_testing/tree/main/src/test/java/BooksRestApiFunctionalTests.java) class
For creating the functional test the [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/) Java library was used together with the [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) framework for full test automation

The performance tests are located under the [src/test/performance_testing](https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/books_rest_api_testing/tree/main/src/test/performance_testing) directory. 
The results from the performance testing are awailable in the [src/main/resources/performance_testing](https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/books_rest_api_testing/tree/main/src/main/resources/performance_testing) directory.
For creating the performance test the [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/) tool was used

The [documentation](https://github.com/MilenaTrajanoska/books_rest_api_testing/tree/main/documentation) directory contains the document with all of the requirement and test case versions created during the project implementation in .xlsx format and the final project documentation in .pdf format.
